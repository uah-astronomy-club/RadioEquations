# Radio_Equations
Equation files for formatting the radio data

Some of this code is used to import the .rad files and plot the data for testing.
The rest of the code can be integrated into the Data_Processing file for running the calculations when it is finished.

## Features:

* Frequency space calculation
* Data outlier removal
* Data averaging
* Velocity of source with respect to standard calculation (uses VLSR)
* Dictionary storage of data within the code for quick access
